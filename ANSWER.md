# 🚀 Answer: How to Push Your "mark2" Branch to the Owner's Repository

## Quick Answer

**You cannot push directly to the owner's repository.** You need to create a **Pull Request** from your fork.

## Your Situation

Based on your question about the "mark2" branch in your forked codebase, here's exactly what you need to do:

### Step 1: Push to YOUR Fork First
```bash
# If you're on the mark2 branch
git push origin mark2

# If mark2 branch doesn't exist yet
git checkout -b mark2
# Make your changes...
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes description"
git push origin mark2
```

### Step 2: Create Pull Request
1. **Go to GitHub** and navigate to your fork: `https://github.com/YourUsername/Fedrated_DDoS_Detection`
2. **Click "Compare & pull request"** (appears after pushing a new branch)
3. **Alternative**: Go to the original repository and click "New pull request" → "compare across forks"

### Step 3: Configure the Pull Request
- **Base repository**: The owner's repository (upstream)
- **Base branch**: `main` (usually)
- **Head repository**: Your fork
- **Compare branch**: `mark2`

## Why This Workflow?

- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized direct changes to the main repository
- **Review**: Allows code review before merging
- **Collaboration**: Enables discussion and feedback
- **History**: Maintains clean commit history

## Visual Workflow

```
Your Fork (origin) ←─────── Push ←─────── Your Local
       │
       │ Pull Request
       ↓
Owner's Repo (upstream)
```
