# Development Strategy: Docker-First Approach

## Phase 1: Local Development (Weeks 1-4)

- ✅ Environment setup with Python virtual environment
- 🔄 Dataset preparation and preprocessing
- 🔄 CNN model development and testing
- 🔄 Basic FL implementation with Flower (single machine, multiple processes)

## Phase 2: Docker Containerization (Weeks 5-6)

- 🔄 Create Dockerfiles for FL client and server
- 🔄 Docker Compose setup for multi-node simulation
- 🔄 Test FL training across Docker containers

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-8)

- 🔄 Security mechanisms and robust aggregation
- 🔄 Attack simulation and defense testing
- 🔄 Comprehensive evaluation and metrics

## Phase 4 (Optional): Kubernetes Migration

- ⏳ Only if time permits and basic goals are achieved
- ⏳ Kubernetes deployment for production-like scaling
- ⏳ Advanced orchestration features

## Current Setup Requirements:

### Essential (Install Now):

1. **Docker Desktop** - Download from docker.com

   - Includes Docker Engine and Docker Compose
   - Enable WSL2 backend on Windows
   - Test with: `docker run hello-world`

2. **Python Environment** - ✅ Already completed
   - Virtual environment with all ML packages
   - Verified and working

### Optional (Later):

1. **Kubernetes** - Only if we want advanced orchestration
   - Minikube for local development
   - Can be added in Phase 4 if needed

## Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Install Docker Desktop** (15 minutes)
2. **Start Phase 2: Dataset Preparation** (our next focus)
3. **Keep Kubernetes for later** (if time permits)

This approach will get you a working federated learning system faster!
