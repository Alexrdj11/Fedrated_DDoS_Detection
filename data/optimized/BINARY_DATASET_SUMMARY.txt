âœ… BINARY DATASET READY FOR FEDERATED LEARNING!

Key advantages of binary classification:
- Faster convergence in federated learning
- More robust to data heterogeneity
- Simpler model architecture
- Better performance with limited data
- Easier to interpret results

Next steps:
1. Run federated training with binary model
2. Use binary_dataset.csv for centralized training
3. Use client_*_train.csv and client_*_test.csv for FL simulation
